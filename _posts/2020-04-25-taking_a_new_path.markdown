If you would have asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, the last thing I would have told you would have been “Software Engineer.” Growing up I wanted to be a Navy SEAL, Pro-Soccer Player, or a Lawyer. My father had told me some cool stories about his time in the service, so at 17 I enlisted for the Navy. I was physically fit enough to pass the test to get in SEAL training, but my ASVAB scores said otherwise. I had decided to take on a Mechanical Technician for since my father has a Government Job with benefits, from the skillset he acquired during his time in service.
I enjoyed using my logical side of during my daily job of fixing machines in the Navy. Troubleshooting machines can be a good stimulator of the mind. When my ship was in port, I spent a majority of my free time training for soccer. I had plans to try and go on trial with a couple of pro teams, but I tore my ACL and both Meniscus in my left knee. After my surgery, I never felt the same. Due to this setback, I decided that I would attend a University and pursue a Computer or Mechanical Engineering when my service time was up. 
I did great during my first 2 semesters at the University, but I really struggled with the higher levels of math. My grades suffered, so I had to make other choices. I worked a couple of gigs as a Mechanical Engineering Technician in the Biomedical and Oil/Gas industries, and during that time I had wanted to go back to school, but one day I let it all go.
I started to build up an interest in the IT/Tech industries. My impression was that one had to get a Computer Science or Computer Engineering degree to get in, but my friends who were in the industry told me that you could get in with certifications. I had dabbled a bit in some HTML/CSS, but I unfortunately had a hard time teaching myself. I had also purchased the CompTIA and CISCO CCNA books, but I didn’t see myself doing Networking or Systems Administration.
I then looked into some articles and YouTube videos about Coding Bootcamps. After doing a thorough risk analysis/assessment, I made the decision to embark on this path. I saw that I could still solve problems and use my logical brain, but with a little bit more of improvisation and creativity. After doing some soul searching and deep reflection, I then realized, I was taking on this path for a reason.
